Once upon a time there 
was a young boy who
ate lots of house dressing
every day for his lunch.
One day, tragedy struck! He
opened up his lunchbox but
there were nothing but Scandinavian
Swimmers! So tasty yet so
bad with dressing. Acting quickly,
he ran across the street.
He needed a sandwich. Stat.
Sadly, his first Forge paycheck
was lost in the sauce.
But suddenly, something amazing happened:
Take-it-Away gifted him a sandwich.
